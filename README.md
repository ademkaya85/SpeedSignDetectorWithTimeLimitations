# SpeedSignDetectorWithTimeLimitations

Traffic sign recognition (TSR) is getting one of the standards of the newest cars. One of the challenges in traffic sign recognition is that in some countries such as Germany, there might be a time limitation represented beneath the speed sign board. It is very difficult to read those time limitations as they are much smaller than the speed limit and they might be very similar as in the case, '22-5h' and '22-6h'. 

The algorithm I developed is able to read the time limitations beneath the speed limit sign while driving. It can differentiate the small differences between time limitations such as in '22-5h' and '22-6h'. 

The video below shows the success of the algorithm. I am eager to implement my algorithm on real cars and I am open to new opportunuties to do this.
